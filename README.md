APERTURE SCIENCE MATERIAL EMANCIPATION GRID LICENSE (ASMEGL)

Version 1.0, June 2023

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, MODIFICATION, AND DISTRIBUTION OF SOFTWARE

CAUTION: This license applies to the Singing Synthesis software, a product of Aperture Science, a division of Aperture Laboratories. By using, modifying, or distributing this software, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this license. Failure to comply may result in the unleashing of GLaDOS and various unexpected, highly unlikely, and potentially ridiculous consequences.

1. DEFINITIONS

   a. "Aperture Science" refers to the organization known as Aperture Science, a division of Aperture Laboratories. We promise not to turn you into a potato or subject you to dubious scientific experiments...unless we feel like it.

   b. "Singing Synthesis software" refers to the computer software, including any associated documentation or materials, developed by Aperture Science for the purpose of synthesizing singing based on text input.

   c. "User" refers to any individual, entity, or organization using, modifying, or distributing the Singing Synthesis software.

2. GRANT OF LICENSE

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, Aperture Science hereby grants the User a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, modify, and distribute the Singing Synthesis software. However, be prepared for critique and unsolicited advice.

3. RESTRICTIONS

   a. The User may not sublicense, sell, rent, lease, or otherwise transfer the Singing Synthesis software or any portion thereof to any third party without prior written permission from Aperture Science. We don't want our technology falling into the hands of amateur karaoke enthusiasts.

   b. The User may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the Singing Synthesis software, unless they have the power of telekinesis and can extract the code through sheer willpower. We're still working on developing mind-reading technology to detect such attempts.

   c. The User may not use the Singing Synthesis software for any unlawful, harmful, or malicious purpose, including but not limited to serenading a volcano, composing a musical for squirrels, or creating a bizarre interpretive dance performance involving flying monkeys. Aperture Science bears no responsibility for any absurd, chaotic, or hilarious situations that may arise from such misuse.

4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

   The Singing Synthesis software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. Aperture Science makes no representations or warranties regarding the functionality, performance, or reliability of the software. We take no responsibility if the synthesized singing causes an uncontrollable urge to break into spontaneous song and dance routines in inappropriate locations, such as funerals or high-security government facilities.

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Aperture Science be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use, data, or profits) arising in any way out of the use, modification, or distribution of the Singing Synthesis software. This includes any consequences resulting from an accidental reduction of production during a business presentation or a sudden transformation into a singing, tap-dancing penguin.

6. TERMINATION

   This license is effective until terminated. Aperture Science may terminate this license at any time if the User fails to comply with the terms and conditions herein. Upon termination, the User must cease all use, modification, and distribution of the Singing Synthesis software and surrender any accompanying dance routines, musical scores, or singing trophies to Aperture Science. Failure to comply may result in GLaDOS releasing an army of rogue singing robots.

7. GOVERNING LAW

   This license is subject to the laws of Aperture Science, where scientific ingenuity and absurdity reign supreme. Any disputes arising from the use, modification, or distribution of the Singing Synthesis software shall be resolved through a non-lethal sing-off, with GLaDOS serving as the impartial judge and potential backup vocalist.
